# StudentExcelSheet
A fully dynamic, backwards compatible Excel sheet for recording the marks for a class of students.

The sheet uses Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) to automatically generate the correct sized sheet 
to accommodate any requested number of students and tests for a class.
The sheet has a front page showing an overview of the students results, as well as an analysis of their marks, 
qualification for supplementary exams, and adjustable weightings for semester and exam marks.
